When you want polymorphism, you should use templates. But sometimes you can't use templates because you won't know the
types used with your code until runtime. Remember that template instantiation only occurs when you pair a template's
parameters with types. At this point, the compiler can instantiate a custom class for you. In some situations, you might
not  be able to perform such pairing at until your program is executing (or at leas, performing such pairing at compile
time would be tedious).

In such cases, you can use runtime polymorphism. Whereas the template is the mechanism for achieving compile-time
polymorphism, the runtime mechanism is the interface.
