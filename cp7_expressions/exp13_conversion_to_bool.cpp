/*
 * Conversion to bool
 *
 * Pointers, integers, and floating-point numbers can all be implicitly converted to bool objects. if the value is
 * nonzero, the result of implicit conversion is true. Otherwise, the result is false. For example, the value
 * int{1} converts to true, and the value int{} converts to false.
