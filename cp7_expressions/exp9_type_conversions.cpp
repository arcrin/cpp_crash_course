/*
 * You perform type conversions when you have one type but want to convert it to another type. Depending on the
 * situation, type conversions can be explicit or implicit. This section treats both sorts of conversions while
 * covering promotions, floating-pointer-to-integer conversions, integer-to-integer conversions, and floating-point
 * to-floating-point conversions.
