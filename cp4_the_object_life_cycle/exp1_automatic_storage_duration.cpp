 * An automatic object is allocated at the beginning of an enclosing code block, and it's deallocated at the end.
 * The enclosing block is the automatic object's scope. Automatic objects are said to have automatic storage duration.
 * Note that function parameters are automatic, even though notationally they appear outside the function body.
