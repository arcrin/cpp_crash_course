/*
 * You can define your own exceptions whenever you'd like; usually, these user-defined exceptions inherit from
 * std::exception. All the classes from stdlib use exceptions that derive from std::exception.
 * This makes it easy to catch all exceptions, whether from your code or from the stdlib, with a single catch block
